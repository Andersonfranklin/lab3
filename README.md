## 3-D Visualization Of The Tallest Things In Vancouver ##
### Things you can see from UBC ###  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most striking things about Vancouver for me as a foreign student was the striking verticality of the city. Both the mountains surrounding and the city itself make Vancouver a very vertically oriented city. From UBC, it feels almost that you are at the bottom of a bowl, with large buildings and even larger mountains surrounding you in almost every direction. This map was made for people who are curious as to what are the tallest things in Vancouver. Essentially, I aimed to create a map for people either from Vancouver or from outside who wanted to know more about what each of the high elevation objects, both natural and man made, were in the city. This map is successful in allowing users to pick and rotate around any point in the city and see what the top ten largest natural and manmade things are from that point.    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the design of this map, I wanted to ensure that users were only given the information that was relevant to this project. As such, I decided to only include the 10 largest buildings by story count (or a few more if there was a tie) and only the mountains that can be seen from within Vancouver. I also chose to use an easily recognizable mountain symbol for the mountains and to color each of the buildings in teal as this is a color that contrasts well with the base satellite imagery used. Unfortunately, building footprint data was not available for West Vancouver, so there is a gap in terms of the tallest buildings for this area.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 3-D perspective is fundamental to the functionality of this map. Showing the tallest things in Vancouver from a 2-D perspective fails to show users what the features actually look like from the ground. A 2-D map shows only the top-down view of the city and thus fails to allow users to gain valuable insight into the true appearance of what these points of interest look like in reality. By presenting data in a 3-D manner, users are more easily able to decipher what they are looking at and spend more time processing the information given to them (in this case mountain and building heights/locations).

Unfortunately, the conversion from qgis2threejs failed to copy over the mountain icons and labels. However, a link to the a-frame version of the same project can be found here: https://luxurious-recess.glitch.me/. Future work would involve recreating the mountain symbols and labels within A-Frame.

The following screenshot shows an interesting part of the data. This point, centered just above and to the left of UBC, shows the vast amount of large mountains surrounding the city. In my opinion, this is what makes Vancouver one of the most aesthetically satisfying cities in the world:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources for this map include the qgis2threejs and A-Frame tutorials given in previous assignments. I gained inspiration for the theme of this map from a visiting friend who was asking a number of questions about which mountains they should hike around the city.
